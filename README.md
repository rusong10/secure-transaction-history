## Things to note:
- If biometric authentication is unavailable, you can use a PIN as an alternative login method.
- The PIN is hardcoded as `147369` and cannot be changed.
- The transaction history data has a 20% chance of failure to simulate network instability.
- Some buttons are non-functional and serve only as part of the frontend design.
- If the app is in the background for more than 1 minute, you will be required to reauthenticate (via biometric authentication or PIN).
